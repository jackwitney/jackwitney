### ðŸ›  Personal Projects & Experiments

As and when  these projects are brought to a ready state I will move them out of private.

# Multi point API interaction application
  Currently exploring the public API ecosystem to create a centralized multi-API endpoint for learning and experimentation.
  
  Particular interests:
  ```
    - Open Bus Data API - Monitor local bus services; plan to display updates on an E Ink screen by my door.
    - Open Marine Data API - Track AliExpress shipments via maritime tracking.
    - OpenWeather API - Fetch weather data to enhance outfit planning.
    - FlightAware API - Track flights in real-time, useful for global shipment monitoring.
    - ExchangeRate API - Get real-time currency conversion rates for trips aborad.
  ```
  I am currently performing the planning, research and development to create a multi api application to deploy on my home network.

# Home Lab / Network

Thankfully, I still live at home and have relatively full control over my network, allowing me to experiment and optimize the household digital experience at the cost of my sanity..  

- Pi-hole â€“ Blocks adverts network-wide, improving speed and privacy for all devices.  
- Homebrewed NAS â€“ Built on a Raspberry Pi 5 with SATA drives in RAID 10, hosting a Plex server for media streaming. Using an imported Pi-5 hat from the states.  
- Network Customization â€“ Using open-source routers and tools to create a high-performance, household-wide network.  
- Future Plans â€“ Looking to migrate to a Ubiquiti NAS solution when available in the UK for more enterprise-grade reliability.  

  Slowly but surely exploring the idea of setting up a Full server rack for the sake of convenience. Additionally wanting to explore Hosting Game servers and the such.
